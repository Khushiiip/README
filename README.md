<br / > 
Welcome to the Budget Program README File. In this file we will talk about navigating your way around the Budget Program. to ensure that you can open the Application make sure that you have Visual Studios installed onto your computer.


How to compile & run the Budget Program 
* Open up the POE Folder 
* We would like for you to first watch the Budget Application tutorial firts to get a better understanding as to how to navigate yourself around the Application 
* After you have watched the budget Application Tutorial we would like for you to findfile named "POE.sin" in the POE Folder. Double click on the file to open the source code. Give the application some time to fully oppen. 
* Once the application has fully oppen and it contentes are ready to run press the run button that can be founf on the top left-hand side of the window. * Give the application some time to open up the terminal and debug the POE source code. 
* Once the application is read to run you will be presented with compuerised prompts that will ask you for your budgeting infromation * you will be able to enter in your information into program after each line of computer prompts that is been presented to you. there will be a blinking found below the promts wich will allow you to enter in your information. 
* once you have entered in your information press the "Enter" key on you keyboard to allow the application to store your details into the program 
* continue to enter your details untill you come to the end of the application and you are displayed with a summary of all your expenditures in decending ourders.
* This summary will help you see how much savings you are left with after all your expences have been deducted at the end of the month. 
* if your expenses are seen to be exceeding more than 75% of your total income for the month you will be notified and the applcation will stop. If the happens we suggest that you reallocate you expences properly or seek some external finacial help to help you. 
* Feel free to rerun the application if you would like to by restarting the proccess for the beging or press the x button which can be found on the right hand coner of the Budget Application Terminal.


# Changes Made in Part2 In PartOne of the application 
* In PartOne I have gotten a low mark (55%) for Task1. This is because I have missed some main components that could have helped me into achieving a better mark. Below is a list of a few things that I have added into PartTwo of the application to achieve a better understanding of the POE.

* The biggest section that I have lost my marks is was in my documentation section of the task. I have misunderstood the assignment and thought that a README file only includes the source code of the application and nothing else. In PartTow of the POE I have made sure to include this README file to help me gain a better mark for the fine POE.
* I have also tried to improve on my coding standards by including more comments to help one navigate their way around the code. I have also made use of more classes and inheritance to present the code more logical format.
* I have added a much more logical if-else statement to make the calculations and logic within the program make more sense when put into use.
* I have also uploaded more videos proofs showing the different scenarios and what would happen if the user choses different options
* I have taken out the array aspect from the application and added in a generic collection to store the expenses of the user
